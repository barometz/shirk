README.md for Shirk
===================

What is Shirk?
--------------
Shirk is a modular IRC bot based on the [Twisted
framework](http://twistedmatrix.com). It is designed to be easy to write
modules for so you can focus on the things you actually want to do.  After
all, if you wanted to mess with IRC internals you wouldn't be using someone
else's bot.

Why?
----
I needed an IRC bot for a certain project.  Didn't feel like using one of the
existing ones as they were either out of development or too much of a hassle
to write plugins for.  Instead, like the curious fool I am, I decided to look
into writing my own.  The project died, I got bored, the project was restarted
and here I am starting all over.
