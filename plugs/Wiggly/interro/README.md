interro
=======
A python module to interactively extract information from users.

Interro essentially provides an interactive questionnaire with live data
validation. The idea originally came up when a shell server needed an
automated signup process through IRC. The code at that time was massively
inflexible and ugly to boot, but interro is intended to be both flexible and
generic, without making it a hassle to set up.

Interro supports branching and different types of questions, such as yes/no
and strings.  Future plans include multiple choice and more explicitly
optional questions, although it remains to be seen whether the latter makes
sense in the format.
